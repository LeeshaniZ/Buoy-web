The IoT buoy system's website, powered by Firebase Realtime Database, delivers reliable, real-time environmental data from lake-deployed sensors. Dynamic dashboards display live graphs and sensor readings, instantly reflecting updates across devices and network conditions. Tested for stability in moderate weather—sunlight, wind, and light rain—the solar-powered, waterproof buoy ensures continuous, long-term performance in natural lake environments, providing seamless remote access to critical data.
